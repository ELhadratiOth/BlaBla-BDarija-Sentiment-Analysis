# Darija Sentiment Analysis Platform

## Overview

This project is a sentiment analysis platform specifically designed for Darija (Moroccan Arabic). Users can analyze sentiment by either inputting simple text or providing a YouTube video URL to evaluate the average sentiment of its comments. Developers can also leverage a REST API to integrate the sentiment analysis model into their own applications.
